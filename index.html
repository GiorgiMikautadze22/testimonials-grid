            <h2 class="main">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>
            <h3 class="pharagraph">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.

Since completing the course, I’ve  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</h3>
